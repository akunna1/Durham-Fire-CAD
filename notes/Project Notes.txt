Project Notes:
- NAD83 / North Carolina State Plane (US feet) EPSG:2264 needs to be reprojected to EPSG:4326 (WGS84 lat/long) because Turf.js, Leaflet, Mapbox cannot use this directly.
- Ctrl + Shift + R helps reset the browser
- Fire should not be called for Omega and Alpha incidents

- npm install -D ts-node @types/node (to make script 1 work)
